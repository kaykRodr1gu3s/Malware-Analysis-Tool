I left the python-3.11.0-amd64.exe as example

### VirusTotal

After you get your API, go to [VirusTotal code](https://github.com/kaykRodr1gu3s/Malware-Analysis-Tool/blob/main/VirusTotal/VirusTotal.py).
Update the code with your VirusTotal API key:

```python
api_key = str('Type here your API')
```

Specify the file name you want to analyze:

```python
file_name = str('Type here the file name')
```

### HybridAnalysis

After you get your API, go to [HybridAnalysis code](https://github.com/kaykRodr1gu3s/Malware-Analysis-Tool/blob/main/HybridAnalysis/Sandbox_HybridAnalysis.py). 

Update the code with your HybridAnalysis API key:

```python
self.api_key = 'API KEY'
```
Specify the file name you want to analyze:

```python
self.file_name = 'python-3.11.0-amd64.exe'
```

The results is a csv and a yaml file. The csv is all the Mitre tactics and techniques, the yaml file is the results of Sandbox Submission File.
